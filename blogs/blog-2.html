        IT’s one of the most loved cartoon by all of us! TOM a cat and Jerry a mouse are usually enemies in most of the episodes and they beat up each other and at the end of each episode there’s always a lesson from that but yeah when any one of them are in trouble! one is always there for the other as a best friend and they get out of it! yeah guys, from this we get fun, relate and enjoy a lot!
    </div>
    <h3 class="container container-center"><span>Doraemon</span></h3>

        Yeah guys you guessed it right! It’s our 21st centuries cat type robot came back to the past to help Nobita the NOOBIE! All his future Gadgets help our noobie to get out of disasters created by his own which seem magical but no it’s the developed science that has made it possible. It may had given you a hope where that you may go back to your past and change it but don’t worry I’ve been there, because it’s natural to get there as I think that is what the cartoon is designed for!

    <h3 class="container container-center"><span>Mr Bean</span></h3>

        I think I was able to take you back to your childhood if you have forgotten about it! If not I tried my best sorry if I was not able to. But guys I just want you to take away that each and every cartoon out there is to entertain us and tie us to it (even movies)! Watch them have fun but don’t forget your passion and addict to any cartoon! I too watch it for fun and for a lot of time and learnt a lesson and I’m just conveying it to you!
